## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-24

### üéâ Minor Release: SET_QUANTITY Support & Multi-CSV Loading

This release adds support for sets with multiple quantities of the same component and the ability to load multiple CSV files at once.

### ‚ú® Added

#### SET_QUANTITY Column Support
- **New optional column** `SET_QUANTITY` in SETS sheet
- Allows sets to contain multiple quantities of the same component
  - Example: A set with 2x Barrier Cream and 1x Box
- **Backward compatible** - defaults to quantity 1 if column not present
- Works with existing master files without modification
- Quantity calculation formula: `order_quantity √ó set_quantity √ó physical_qty`
- Example use case:
  ```
  SET_Name: Barrier Bundle
  SET_SKU: SET-BARRIER
  Components:
    - BARRIER-CREAM (SET_QUANTITY: 2)
    - BOX-SMALL (SET_QUANTITY: 1)

  Order: 3x Barrier Bundle ‚Üí Results in:
    - 6x BARRIER-CREAM (3 √ó 2 √ó 1)
    - 3x BOX-SMALL (3 √ó 1 √ó 1)
  ```

#### Multi-CSV Loading
- **Load folder with multiple CSV files** at once
- New "Load Folder with CSV Files" button in GUI
- All CSV files in selected folder are automatically combined
- Files are sorted alphabetically before combining
- Shows detailed message with all loaded file names
- Perfect for processing multiple order exports in one go
- **Still supports single file loading** - choose what works best for you

### üîß Changed
- GUI now has two separate buttons:
  - "Load Single CSV File" (existing functionality)
  - "Load Folder with CSV Files" (new)
- SetManager.get_components() now returns `List[Dict[str, any]]` instead of `List[str]`
  - Each dict contains: `{'sku': str, 'quantity': int}`
- OrderProcessor._decode_set() updated to use set_quantity from components
- Demo files updated to include SET_QUANTITY column examples

### üìä Testing
- Added 3 new tests for SET_QUANTITY in test_set_manager.py
- Added 2 new tests for SET_QUANTITY with order processing
- Created new test_file_handlers.py with 9 tests for multi-CSV loading
- Updated existing tests to work with new dict-based component format
- Total tests increased from 69 to 83
- All tests passing (100% success rate)

### üìù Documentation
- Updated README with v2.1 features
- Added SET_QUANTITY column to master file documentation
- Added multi-CSV loading instructions
- Added example showing Barrier Bundle with SET_QUANTITY
- Updated CHANGELOG with v2.1 changes

### üîÑ Compatibility
